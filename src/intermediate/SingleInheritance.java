//Inheritance is one of the OOPS concepts using which we can inherit the parent class properties into the child class. This can be done extends keyword
//Inheritance is adopted for better code reusability.

//Single inheritance --> If only a single child class has inherited the parent class then it is called as Single inheritance

//Parent class or Base class
class Animal

	String animalName="dog";
