Local variable--> variables that are declared within the method and it will have the scope only within the same method
instance variable--> variables that are declared outside of all the methods and it will have scope for all the methods inside the class.
						The values of the instance variables will change based on the instance or object of the class
						
static variable-> 
 * Here vehicleName and price are instance variables and its value will change based on the instance
 * Whereas vehicleType is a static variable which belongs to the complete class. Once a value is set, it will reflect for all instances or objects
 * We use static for efficient memory mgmt. Since the static variable or method belongs to the complete, we should call them using classname.variablename
